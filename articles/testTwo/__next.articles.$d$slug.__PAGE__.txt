2:T423,Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of
"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on
the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of
Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus
Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the
1914 translation by H. Rackham.3:T423,Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
